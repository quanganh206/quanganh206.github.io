*"That articles not for war, it is just my own question for the next step of developing new Mobile App."*

![Flutter vs Ionic4](https://www.xmobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ionic-flutter.png){:class="img-responsive"}

A bit of my working history with Ionic and Cordova go to _(1)_

Few months ago Flutter going to a hot trends in Mobile Development. Yes, nice, high quality UI with smooth animations and an active community! If you can not see that, please follow Flutter community in Twitter or Facebook, search in Github. Flutter news, new projects everyday, very very active!!!

My own loved one, Ionic, still stuck with 4 beta version. But I think community will need to stay with version 3 for longtime. Ionic have new community strategy with some familiar faces in Ionic community to warn up community but I do not think it active more than Flutter community right now.

No one know everything at all so an active community even with pay support will help you solve problem and make your project run faster.

Back to Flutter and Ionic, let's think about a real app with a list of UIs, functions below:

| Components    | Ionic 4  | Flutter |
| ------------- |:--------:| -------:|
| Side Menu     |    x     |    x    |
| Tabs          |    x     |    x    |
| Navigation    |    x     |    x    |

Yes all have basic functions, you can easy to create Tabs and Side Menu with Ionic 4 but I think you also can create Flutter Tabs and Side Menu "ezily" with Flutter TabBar and Drawer (for Side Menu). Learning curve with Dart not so hard, change **npm install** with **flutter packages get** you have the same functions. Navigation with Flutter very clear with push and pop, Ionic 4 especial for Angular users use Angular Route. I do think Navigation is hard for Ionic Angular users but convert from 3 to 4 version will be a nightmare. (One more thing in Ionic 4 now when I test Top Tabbar still not working in Ionic Angular)

For other UI components to quickly build UI, Ionic provide a set of build-in components like Card, Scroll, Sliders etc. Flutter not, but I think after 1 or 2 projects you will have a set to use on your own. Not easy but you can do that.

Working with Backend API 2 frameworks also do a good thing. The next thing is some special support for real app. Firebase, Firestore yes all have. Overall what I need to develop a new Mobile App now Flutter can support the same thing as Ionic support. I did not find anything Flutter not support now with what I need.

More dig into Flutter I have 1 problem with Payment. You do not have Paypal or Stripe plugins like Ionic/Cordova. You just can use Paypal or Stripe in Webview.

(1) I play with Cordova then Ionic over 5 years. On the way going with Ionic sometime I work with Framework7, Onsen UI, and I have 1 project with Sencha Touch :D but still stay with Ionic and it's community. And really I do working with React Native too.
